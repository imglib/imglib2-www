[Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) is an image processing packageâ€”a "batteries-included" distribution of [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/software/imagej) and [ImageJ2](https://imagej.net/software/imagej2), bundling a lot of plugins which facilitate scientific image analysis.

The ImageJ2 data model underlying Fiji is built on [ImgLib2](/imglib2), and Fiji includes the [BigDataViewer](/bdv) in its distribution, along with many plugins making use of these two technologies.
