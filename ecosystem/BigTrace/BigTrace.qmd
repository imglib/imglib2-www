FIJI plugin for tracing and analysis of curvilinear structures (filaments, vessels, neurites) in volumetric microscopy datasets.

The plugin implements 3D ROIs (points, straight/curved lines, planes)
for manual/semi-automatic segmentation of lines, curves, and spotty objects.
It allows volumetric measurements of intensity and geometrical features.
The plugin is scriptable using ImageJ macros.
