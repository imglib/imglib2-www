::: {.alignleft}

An ImageJ plugin for spatial correlation/colocalization analysis that is more compatible with super-resolution images than traditional pixel-wise colocalization algorithms. Has several benefits over pixel-wise algorithms:

 - Removes the requirement for overlap of the signals, instead allowing for spatial correlation to be measured across a distance.
 - Results directly improve with improved image quality and resolution. In contrast, pixel-wise methods must be correctly interpreted using the image resolution for context, a challenging prospect for general users. 
 - Designed to be simple to execute, taking only two single-channel images, a mask of the region to be analyzed, and a few utility options as input.
