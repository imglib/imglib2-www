It implements several data sources and sample organizations, including one single primitive array, one array per plane, N-dimensional array “cells” cached to and from disk on demand, and planes read on demand from disk.\n\n\n\n# BigdataViewer  (logo just a temporary placeholder for now)\n##### The BigDataViewer is a re-slicing browser for terabyte-sized multi-view image sequences. \n##### Conceptually, the visualized data comprises multiple data sources. Each source provides one 3D image (for each time-point in  the case of a time-lapse sequence or angle for a multi-angle SPIM dataset).\n\n##### BigDataViewer comes with a custom data format that is is optimized for fast random access to very large data sets. This permits browsing to any location within a multi-terabyte recording in a fraction of a second. The file format is based on XML and HDF5. Images are represented as tiled multi-resolution pyramids, and stored in HDF5 chunked multi-dimensional arrays with metadata contained in the XML file. BigDataViewer was developed with multi-view light-sheet microscopy data in mind and integrates well with Fiji’s SPIMage processing pipeline.\n\n\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n![](imglib2-logo.svg){fig-align=\"left\" width=20% height=20%}\n![](BDV_logo_cropped2.svg){fig-align=\"right\" width=20% height=20%}\n\n  \n::: {.alignleft}   \n# ImgLib2  \n\n##### This is the joint landing page for ImgLib2 and BigDataViewer projects!\n##### ImgLib2 is a general-purpose, multidimensional image processing library.\n##### It provides an interface-driven design that supports numeric and non-numeric data types (8-bit unsigned integer, 32-bit floating point, etc.) in an extensible way.
