Install OpenJDK and maven:\n```\nsudo apt install openjdk-16-jdk maven\n```\n\nThen check out [BigDataViewer vistools](https://github.com/bigdataviewer/bigdataviewer-vistools):\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/bigdataviewer/bigdataviewer-vistools.git\n```\n\nThen start JShell in the BigDataViewer vistools project directory:\n```\ncd bigdataviewer-vistools\nmvn compile com.github.johnpoth:jshell-maven-plugin:1.3:run\n```\n\nThen try out this code snippet:\n```java\nimport bdv.util.*;\nimport net.imglib2.position.FunctionRealRandomAccessible;\nimport net.imglib2.type.numeric.integer.IntType;\nimport net.imglib2.util.Intervals;\n\nBdvFunctions.show(\n  new FunctionRealRandomAccessible<IntType>(\n    2,\n    (x, y) -> {\n      int i = 0;\n      double v = 0,\n        c = x.getDoublePosition(0),\n        d = x.getDoublePosition(1);\n      for (; i < 64 && v < 4096; ++i) {\n        final double e = c * c - d * d;\n        d = 2 * c * d;\n        c = e + 0.2;\n        d += 0.6;\n        v = Math.sqrt(c * c + d * d);\n        ++i;\n      }\n      y.set(i);\n    },\n    IntType::new),\n  Intervals.createMinMax(-1, -1, 1, 1),\n  \"\",\n  BdvOptions.options().is2D()).setDisplayRange(0, 64);\n```\n\n\n## Making Contributions\nPlease see the general guidlines on how to contribute to an existing plugin or library: [https://imagej.net/develop/improving-the-code](https://imagej.net/develop/improving-the-code)\n\n### Creating Issues\n\nIf you find a bug, have a feature request, or encounter any issues, please search our [ImgLib2 issue tracker](https://github.com/imglib/imglib2/issues) and to see if it has already been reported. If not, feel free to create a new issue and provide as much detail as possible. \n\n### Working on Issues\n\nIf you want to work on an existing issue, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Comment on the issue to express your interest in working on it.\n2. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your work.\n3. Make your changes and commit them with clear commit messages.\n4. Ensure your code follows our Code Guidelines.\n5. Update the documentation if necessary.\n6. Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.\n\n### Submitting Pull Requests\n\n1. Push your changes to your forked repository.\n2. Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to our main repository's appropriate branch.\n3. Provide a detailed description of your changes in the PR.\n4. Reference any related issues using keywords (e.g., \"Closes #123\").\n5. Be ready to address feedback and make necessary changes.\n\n## Code Guidelines\n\n- Use consistent code formatting and style throughout the project.\n- Follow naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.\n- Ensure your code is well-documented.\n- Write meaningful commit messages.\n\n## Testing\n\nExplain how to run tests and provide information about the testing framework used.\n\n## Documentation\n\nIf your changes introduce new features or modify existing ones, please update the documentation accordingly. This includes code comments, README files, and any additional documentation files.\n\n## Community\n\nJoin in our community discussions on [imagesc.zulipchat.com](https://imagesc.zulipchat.com/) for discussions.
